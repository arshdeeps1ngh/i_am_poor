# "I Am Poor" App

Welcome to the "I Am Poor" app, a simple iOS application developed as a part of Angela Yu's Udemy iOS 13 Development Course. This app is designed to showcase the basic concepts of iOS app development using Swift and the UIKit framework. Please note that this app is for educational purposes only and is not intended to be used for any practical purpose.

## App Description

The "I Am Poor" app is a minimalistic and humorous application that displays a static image of a piece of coal along with the text "I Am Poor." The purpose of this app is to demonstrate the process of creating a basic iOS app using Xcode, Swift, and Interface Builder. This app does not have any dynamic functionality, interactions, or advanced features.

## Features

- Display of a static image: The main screen of the app displays a fixed image of a piece of coal.
- Text display: The text "I Am Poor" is shown beneath the image, adding a touch of humor to the app.

## Development Environment

To run the "I Am Poor" app on your local machine, you will need:

- Xcode: Make sure you have Xcode installed, as it's the primary development environment for iOS apps.
- Swift: The app is developed using the Swift programming language, so familiarity with Swift basics is helpful.
- UIKit: The app uses UIKit for building the user interface.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.
4. Explore the app's basic user interface and static content.

## App Structure

The app's codebase is organized as follows:

- **Main.storyboard**: Contains the main user interface layout, including the image view and label.
- **ViewController.swift**: Handles the logic for displaying the static image and text.
- **Assets.xcassets**: Contains the image resources used in the app.
